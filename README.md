# sorting-algo-assign

A project investigating the performance of different sorting algorithms



## Initial Setup: 
* [Learn about Markdown format](https://commonmark.org/help/)
* [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
* [Learn about Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control)

## Requirements (simplified, check assignment for details)
1.	Create a program that generate an array of sizes n= 10, 100, 500, 5000 and 25000 items with randomly generated integers between 0 and 2n, n = size of the array
2. Create an implementation for the following sort operations.
    1. Bubble sort
    2. Insertion sort
    3. Merge-sort
    4. Quicksort
    5. Heap-sort
    6. Counting sort
    7. Radix-sort
3. Test the sort operations with std::chrono
    1. Record the time to sort for each algorithm with each size array
4. Write a linked list class containing student information
    * Data should include First name, Last name, and MNumber
    * It should be sortable by using 3 of the above algorithms by First Name, Last Name, and MNumber, ascending or descending
    * Seed the linked list with data for 50 students
    * Make a menu interface to select the type of sort+direction to run and display the sorted result

## Deliverables
* Submit all source code files and any required data files in a zip file.  
* Include a write up as a PDF including:
    * The name of all group members
    * Instructions for compiling and running the program including any files or folders that must exist.
    * What each group member contributed.  If the contributions are not equitable, what portion of the grade each group member should receive.
    * Table and graph from requirement 2 along with your writeup of the results from that requirement.
